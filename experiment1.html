				  You have entered blockworld, inhabited by people whose only interest is in arranging colored blocks into patterns.

				  <p>Your task is to learn the blockworld language, use it to arrange blocks, and finally create new instructions in the langauge. It’s a difficult task, but we think you’re up to it!

				  <h2>Phase 1</h2>
				  <p>Your goal is to learn the blockworld language, and to follow instructions in the language to arrange blocks.							
				  <p>You will see several tasks. Each task includes a instructions in the blocksworld language, a starting pattern of blocks that you need to modify, and a workspace that you can take blocks from or put them into. You will have a few chances to find the right pattern. If you run out of chances, you'll be shown the right one and move to the next task.

				  <h2>Phase 2</h2>
				  You will use what you have learned to create instructions for another person. You will see the starting pattern, the pattern the person must create, and the blocks in the person's workspace. You will have a special keyboard to write instructions in the blocksworld langauge, using the sounds the language is built out of.
				  <p>Another person might have to use your instructions, so choose them carefully!</p>

				  <p>There are several words to learn and it might be difficult to remember everything. Just do your best and know that it's ok to make mistakes. 
				  
					<p><span style="color:red;font-size:16px;">Warning: </span>Please don't use the back button to try to go back to an earlier task. Just do the best you can on each task.
