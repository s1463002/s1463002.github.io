				<h3>Part 2 Instructions:</h3>
				<br/>
				Now that you've learned about the blockworld language, it's time to create instructions for someone else to follow! Just like in part 1, there is a workspace and a starting pattern, but now you get to see the goal pattern, and need to come up with instructions in the blockworld language to help someone create it. Below is a schematic the the task screen, and the steps in each task. If you don't remember the language exactly, don't worry -- just do the best you can.
				<div style="position: absolute;top:50px;padding:50px;" >					
					<center><img src="instruction2.gif" style="cursor:not-allowed;" width="50%" height="50%" ></center>
					<ol>
						<li>Check out which blocks you have in the block section.</li>
						<li>Check out how is the task before and after solved.</li>
						<li>Write an instruction with everything you learned before using these keys.</li>
						<li>Press submit when you are done (Be careful and make the instruction understable and with logic using the vocabulary from the tasks you solved).</li>
					</ol> 					
					<!--p>You have a number of attempts on each task shown in <span class="numberCircle">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</span-->					
					<h3>Buttons</h3>
					<p><strong>Delete</strong>: Press the button to delete the last token.</p>
					<p><strong>Submit</strong>: Press the button when you have the desired block pattern to evaluate if its correct.</p>

				<h3>About the game:</h3>
				<br/>				
				<div style="position: absolute;top:50px;padding:50px;" >
					<center><img width="10%" height="10%" src="blocks.png"></center>
					<p><strong>In this game, I am investigating the difficulties and the ability of participants to communicate through different tasks 
					with an artificial vocabulary.</strong></p>	
					<p>As a player, you need to understand as much as you can the meaning of the instructions and solve the tasks remembering their meaning. 
					Harder tasks contain a combination of different words from easier tasks. The more you understand each word, 
					the easier it will be to solve the following tasks.</p>					
					<p>The objective of the game is to solve all tasks correctly understanding the words given and to 
					create instructions for the next participant to solve the same tasks using your instructions. 
					The instructions should be clear, short, and easy to understand for next participants.</p>
					<p><span style="color:red;font-size:16px;">Warning: </span>Once you have done a task you can not go back to a previous task, 
					you need to pay attention and try to get the idea of the instruction before going to the next task.
					You have a fixed number of attempts on each task, therefore, is not a good idea to try random sequences.</p>
