			<h3>Web Game For Studying Language Evolution.</h3>
			<p>This is a game designed to help us understand languages and how they evolve over time. Players will use instructions in a made-up language to communicate with each other and solve different tasks.
			</p>
			<p>
		  The game has two parts. In part 1, you will arrange blocks, based on instructions in the made-up language. In part 2, you will give instructions in the language to someone else.
		  Finally, there will be a very short survey about the game. We will not share any personally identifying or sensitive information with any third parties.
			</p>
			<p>The game and survey should take less than 30 minutes to complete. You can withdraw at any time.
			</p>
			<p>If you have questions or concerns, please contact us (Dr. Chris Lucas and Omar Abarca Arriaga) at shrdlevo@gmail.com.
			</p>
			<p>Do you agree to take part in this study?
