			<h3>Web Game For Studying Language Evolution.</h3>
			<p>
				I am a student in MSc Artificial Intelligence. For my dissertation, I have selected to study the language evolution with a web game. The game consists of participants using instructions in an artificial language to communicate with each other and solve different tasks.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this game, I am investigating the difficulties and the ability of participants to communicate through different tasks with an artificial vocabulary. At the end of the tasks, I will ask for some information about yourself, the game and any issue solving or understanding the tasks, and the game interface. The game does not ask you details to identify you and the responses will be used only for the dissertation. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Completing the game and survey will take about 30 minutes. No personal identifying information would be shared. You can drop at anytime.
			</p>
			<p>
				This project has undergone ethical screening in accordance with the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics ethics process (RT1432). For any complain or query feel free to send an e-mail to the supervisor of this project Chris Lucas to clucas2@inf.ed.ac.uk, or to myself Omar Abarca Arriaga to s1463002@sms.ed.ac.uk
			</p>
			<p>
				Do you agree to take part in this study, and do you agree that I can use your data for my Dissertation project in a web game for studying language evolution?
